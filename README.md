# quiz
Program where questions and answers in a txt file can be loaded into a qualified random Quiz
This Program takes a .txt file with any size of questions and answers. 
Then it shows a quiz where questions are shown randomly and answers are shuffled. 
You can select the number of questions to be shown and these are not repeated unless you empty the doneQs.txt file.
The program grades your answers and shows you the correct one if you select the wrong one.
The program is initially made for questions with 4 answers. It can be easily changed at the code level to any number of answers.
